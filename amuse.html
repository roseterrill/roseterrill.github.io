    <h2>The Onion</h2>
    <img src="images/onion.jpg" alt="The Onion Logo" style="float:left">
    <p><em>The Onion</em> is a parody news site that publishes articles parodying current news topics. The headlines of <em>The Onion</em> articles are characterized by straightforward humor. The reason I find <em>The Onion</em> funny is because the headlines are always delivered very seriously.</p>

    <h2>Cookie Clicker</h2>
    <img src="images/cookieclicker.png" alt="The Onion Logo" style="float:left">
    <p>Cookie Clicker is a web game where the player clicks to make cookies (at the start, only chocolate chip) that can be used to buy upgrades that will auto-click for the player. The goal of the game is to amass lots of cookies, but the game is theoretically endless. I usually get bored at around a trillion cookies (which takes a few days of idle auto-clicking) so I don't know if the game can actually end.</p>

    <h2>Disney's Fastpass</h2>
    <img src="images/defunctland.jpg" alt="The Onion Logo" style="float:left">
    <p>Defunctland is a YouTube channel that publishes video essays based on amusement parks. Their video essay on the history of Disney's Fastpass system is pretty cool, kind of long, and funny at times.</p>
