    <p>I'm an English major with a concentration in Writing, Editing, and Publishing, and I'm minoring in Spanish and Digital Marketing. In my free time, I write and do jigsaw puzzles. I serve as Editor in Chief of Her Campus UNCO, which is a women's magazine that my friend and I are starting very soon at UNC!</p>
