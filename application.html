    <h1>Cookie Clicker</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Cookie Clicker is a web game where the player clicks to make cookies. The goal of the game is to amass lots of cookies, but the game is theoretically endless. I usually get bored at around a trillion cookies (which takes a few days of idle auto-clicking) so I don't know if the game can actually end.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click on the chocolate chip cookie in the center. You can't miss it.</li>
        <li>Keep clicking until you amass 100 cookies.</li>
        <li>Click on the cookie in the bottom left corner labeled <strong>+1 cpc</strong>. You are now baking 2 cookies per 1 click.</li>
        <li>Click on the cookie in the bottom left corner labeled <strong>+1 cps</strong>. You are now baking 1 cookie per 1 second, which means your cookies will amass automatically.</li>
        <li>Continue clicking or leave your browser running to amass more cookies. Once you have more cookies, buy more upgrades to increase your <strong>cpc</strong> or <strong>cps</strong>.</li>
        <li>Your goal is to make as many cookies as possible. There is no end. Good luck!</li>
      </ul>
