</h2>Gillian Flynn is an American author and screenwriter.</h2>
</h2>She has written 3 full-length thriller novels: Gone Girl, Sharp Objects, and Dark Places.<h2>
</h2>All 3 novels have screen adaptations, and she penned the screenplays for the movie adaptation of Gone Girl and the TV adaptation of Sharp Objects, receiving critical acclaim.<h2>
</h2>(The only one that didn't get critical acclaim was the 2015 movie adaptation of Dark Places, which she didn't write. But HBO ordered a limited series adaptation, which she will write--and will most definitely be critically acclaimed for!)<h2>
</h2>She's my "hero" because she's a great author, and even if I don't write thriller books, it's pretty awesome that she got to/is going to adapt all her works herself, rather than letting some man do it, which is probably why Dark Places (2015) flopped...</h2>
