  <h1>Gillian Flynn</h1>
  <img src="images/gillian-flynn-2.jpg" alt="Gillian Flynn from Wikipedia" class="header">
  <p>Gillian Flynn is an American author and screenwriter.</p>
  <p>She has written 3 full-length thriller novels: Gone Girl, Sharp Objects, and Dark Places.</p>
  <p>All 3 novels have screen adaptations, and she penned the screenplays for the movie adaptation of Gone Girl and the TV adaptation of Sharp Objects, receiving critical acclaim.</p>
  <p>(The only one that didn't get critical acclaim was the 2015 movie adaptation of Dark Places, which she didn't write. But HBO ordered a limited series adaptation, which she will write--and will most definitely be critically acclaimed for!)</p>
  <p>She's my "hero" because she's a great author, and even if I don't write thriller books, it's pretty awesome that she got to/is going to adapt all her works herself, rather than letting some man do it, which is probably why Dark Places (2015) flopped...</p>
